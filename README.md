# ATEK-SNEK README
This is a remake of the popular snake game with multiple new features such as python and snake trivia popup quizzes, a lives system, a levels system, score tracking, different sprites, and added sounds.
The player starts with 3 lives and loses a life for each incorrectly answered question, which appears every 5 points earned from eating food.
The level system works in a way where the snake's speed is increased for each wrong answer to the pop quiz.
When the player loses all lives, the score tracker prompts the user to enter a name to save the score to.

USAGE:
To play the game, download the zip file, extract it, open the extracted folder in a editor such as VSCode, and run the main.py file.
